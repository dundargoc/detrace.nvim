# detrace.nvim

## Warning

Not ready for use

## Motivation

Idea courtesy of @echasnovski:

We will write a plugin 'detrace.nvim' (DElete TRAiling whitespACE). Here are the basic requirements for it:

- Be able to delete trailing whitespace for every line in current buffer.
- Be able to delete trailing blank lines in current buffer.
- Implement user command to delete trailing whitespace. User should be able to configure which type of whitespace they want to delte.
- Implement Lua function to delete trailing whitespace. User also should be able to configure it.
- Create mapping to delete trailing whitespace.
- Be configurable as to which kind of whitespace should be deleted by default.
